The spdyn Dynamic DNS Update-Client is based on the spdns Dynamic DNS Update-Client from http://my5cent.spdns.de/de/posts/spdns-dynamic-dns-update-client

I change the URLs from spdns.de to spdyn.de

spdny is an Offer from Securepoint GmbH. In 2016, the Securepoint GmbH has renamed his own DDNS service from spdns to spdyn.

spdyn is an Dynamic DNS Service from Securepoint GmbH. The servers of Securepoint GmbH and also the servers of the dynamic DNS service spdyn are in Germany.
